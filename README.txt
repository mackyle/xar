and bug fixes including very basic command line signature support.

The project page with extensive documentation on signing, pre-bootstrapped
downloads, etc. can be found at:

Enhancements
------------
See the xar/NEWS file for release notes and the xar/ChangeLog file for a more
detailed list.

Notable enhancements are command line signature support, --strip-components and
--to-stdout support, cygwin build support, support for arbitrary checksum
message digests (e.g. sha256, sha512), improved liblzma compatibility, many
new command synonyms, and lots and lots of bug fixes and warning eliminations.

See the xar/NEWS and/or xar/ChangeLog file for the full list.

--------
Building
--------
A standard configure and make will suffice.  If building directly from the git
sources the xar/autogen.sh script must be run to generate the configure script.
The autogen.sh script takes a single, optional "--noconfigure" argument to
suppress running configure.  If building from a release tarball, the configure
script has already been generated.

After a successful configure simply do a standard make, but it must be GNU make
(which is typically installed as either make or gmake).

After a successful build, the standard "sudo make install" (again GNU make must
be used) will install.

See the xar/INSTALL file for additional information.

Pre-bootstrapped xar release tarballs (i.e. with configure already generated)
can be found in the downloads section of the project page at:
