<!-- SUMMARY: File Flags Metadata -->
== File Flags Metadata ==

chflags(2) (<tt>st_flags</tt>) metadata support. Per-file settable attributes. Typically implemented on BSD platforms.

=== Metadata supported ===

For platforms that support them:
* User No Dump
* User Immutable
* User Append
* User Opaque
* System Archived
* System Immutable

=== Implementation status ===

Implemented since repository revision 92 (2007-01-29).

=== Notes ===

* Note that some flags have overlap and may be duplicated with other metadata support. Most notably this happens with [[metadata_linux_attrib|Linux EXT2 file attributes]].
* Archival of flags is implemented using the <tt>st_flags</tt> struct member of the [[metadata_stat|stat metadata]] on platforms that support it.
* Extraction of flags is implemented using the chflags(2) APIs on platforms that support it.
