FreeBSD-style Extended Attributes. The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes#FreeBSD Wikipedia ACLs entry on FreeBSD ACLs] has a good overview.

Implemented.

=== Notes ===

* Attempting to read the system namespace while not a privileged user is expected to return an error. The system namespace is used, among other things, for storing kernel extended attributes such as ACLs.
