Add/set a property

==== Description ====

XAR properties are the equivalent of XML tags. For example, a XAR property of "foo" with a value of "bar" would serialize in XML to become:
<pre>
<foo>
	<bar>
</foo>
</pre>

xar_prop_set() will create a new property if it doesn't already exist, and if the property does exist, its value is set to the value specified. Properties can be specified using '/'s as parent/child delimiters. For example, using "foo/bar" will map to the XML equivalent of:
<pre>
<foo>
	<bar>value</bar>
</foo>
</pre>

Properties may have NULL values. The return value is 0 for success, -1 for failure.

The normal keys for files and their values are:
{| border=1 cellpadding=3 style='border-collapse: collapse'
|name ||	The name of the file. If the filename is not representable in UTF8, the filename is base64 encoded and an "encoding" attribute specifies that the name is in base64 encoding.
|-
|type ||file, directory, fifo, character special, block special, socket 
|-
| uid ||	a numeric string representing the file's unix user id 
|-
| gid ||	a numeric string representing the file's unix user id 
|-
| mode ||	Octal numeric string representing the file's unix permissions 
|-
| user ||	The username mapping for the user owning the file at the time and on the system it was archived. 
|-
| group ||	The group name mapping for the user owning the file at the time and on the system it was archived. 
|-
| size ||	a numeric string representing the overall size of the file
|}

==== Example ====
<pre>
#include <xar/xar.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	xar_t x;
	xar_file_t f;

	x = xar_open(argv[1], WRITE);
	if( x == NULL ) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Error opening xarchive: %s\n", argv[1]);
		exit(1);
	}

	f = xar_add(x, "/tmp/foo");
	if( f == NULL ) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Error adding file to the archive\n");
		exit(2);
	}

	xar_prop_set(f, "foo", "bar");

	...

	xar_close(x);
	
	...

}

</pre>
