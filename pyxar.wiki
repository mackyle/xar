<!-- SUMMARY: pyxar!  The Python bindings for xar. -->
<!-- LABELS: pyxar -->

== Introduction ==

The Python bindings for xar currently include a single Python module, [[pyxar_API_xarfile|xarfile]], which attempts to be as compatible with the Python tarfile module as reasonably possible.

pyxar is currently under active development, and as such, is incomplete. A brief "todo" list of known issues/unimplemented features is included below.

There existed a previous Python module for xar, simply named xar, but it has been deprecated.

== Todo ==

* Most errors are not properly handled
* [[pyxar_API_xarfile_XarArchive|XarArchive]] should implement Python container methods
* [[pyxar_API_xarfile_XarArchive|XarArchive]] needs general clean-up and organization to remove the redundant code
* [[pyxar_API_xarfile_XarInfo|XarInfo]] filetype methods needs implementing
